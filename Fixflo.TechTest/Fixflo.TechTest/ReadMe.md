This is a tech test for Fixflo. 

There is nothing complicated in this test beyond seeing how you would restructure code, use patterns, implement best practise and apply your coding techniques. 

Nothing in here is designed to trip you up, other than glaring errors.  

You are at liberty to use the internet, reserch, learn, whatever you would do in in a real working situation. 

This application is a simple, gibberish console application which processes some number and text. 

None of the methods or calculations make sense. It does nothing sensible. That is not the point. 

There are many deliberate errors. This is not a TDD test. There is no desired outcome here. This is a style + patterns test.

The point of the test is to tidy up.

What I would like to see is the 

	1) Implementation of appropriate values from configuration files. 
	2) Dependency injection used where appropriate. You choose the IoC framework.
	3) SOLID principles applied. 
	4) At least one unit test in a framework of your choice
	5) You can amend the structure of the application in any way you see fit. 
		- There is no console outcome we need to see. 
		- Just better code. 
		- A better application

This should take 1 hour or so. Anything more and we have the test wrong, we have not explained well enough, or perhaps this test has proved it's worth.

This test might not be fair and you might have questions. Annotate them. 

Relax. Enjoy it. 


### IMPORTANT ###

The methods called GetMagicNumber must remain. This is a placeholder for a long running method which ALWAYS returns the same value under all conditions. 
You can change the name if you want, you can change the number 6, but it must always be the same number and the method must be called. 

You need to complete the Fibonacci method. A classic test. You make the choices here about scope.
